## C Simple Pyramid Appication (2016_03_15)
# Directions:

Complete and submit Programming Exercise #5 listed on Page 242, Chapter 6 of your textbook.  Use of C compiler and submission of complied version of your C program is required to receive credits. Submit a screenshot of the executed program and the code of the program.

# Exercise 5:
Have a program request the user to enter an uppercase letter. Use nested loops to produce a pyramid pattern like this:

```        A
          ABA 
         ABCBA 
        ABCDCBA
       ABCDEDCBA 
```

The pattern should extend to the character entered. For example, the preceding pattern would result from an input value of E. 
# Hint: 
Use an outer loop to handle the rows. Use three inner loops in a row, one to handle the spaces, one for printing letters in ascending order, and one for printing letters in descending order. If your system doesnâ€™t use ASCII or a similar system that represents letters in strict number order, see the suggestion in programming exercise 3
