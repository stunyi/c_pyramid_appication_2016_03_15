Directions:

Complete and submit Programming Exercise #5 listed on Page 242, Chapter 6 of your textbook.  Use of C compiler and submission of complied version of your C program is required to receive credits. Submit a screenshot of the executed program and the code of the program.



Exercise 5. Have a program request the user to enter an uppercase letter. Use nested loops to produce a pyramid pattern like this:

     A 

   ABA 

  ABCBA 

 ABCDCBA 

ABCDEDCBA 


The pattern should extend to the character entered. For example, the preceding pattern would result from an input value of E. Hint: Use an outer loop to handle the rows. Use three inner loops in a row, one to handle the spaces, one for printing letters in ascending order, and one for printing letters in descending order. If your system doesn’t use ASCII or a similar system that represents letters in strict number order, see the suggestion in programming exercise 3
